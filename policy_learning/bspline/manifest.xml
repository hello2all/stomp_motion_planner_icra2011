    This software is written by Gary Granger of the National Center for
    Atmospheric Research (NCAR), sponsored by the National Science Foundation
    (NSF). The algorithm is based on the cubic spline described by Katsuyuki
    Ooyama in Montly Weather Review, Vol 115, October 1987.  This
    implementation has benefited from comparisons with a previous FORTRAN
    implementation by James L. Franklin, NOAA/Hurricane Research Division.

    This package does not modify the BSpline library in any way; it simply
    provides a convenient way to download and compile the headers and library
    in a way that can be managed by the ROS dependency system.
